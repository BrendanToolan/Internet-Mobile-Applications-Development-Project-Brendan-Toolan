Internet Mobile Applications Development Project by Brendan Toolan
For my porject I decided to make the game tic tac toe. For those that dont know, this game is where there is a 3x3 grid. 
Two players then decide who is X and who is O.
The players then take turns putting either a X or O into a spuare. 
The goal of the game is to try to get three in a row before the other player does.
In my project the player can hover a space (or button) on the grid. 
Once the player clicks on the square, either a X or 0 will appear and stays there.
Once theres three in a row, the game stops. 
Text then appears on the bottom on the game saying the winner of the game.
e.g. "Player X Wins" or "Player O Wins".
The game can be started over again if the player presses the reset button
Once the reset button is pressed all the X's and O's disappear.
The players then can play again if they wanted to.
